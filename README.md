# Ambulance Permitting Modernization Project

This project aims to modernize the ambulance permitting process in West Virginia by leveraging RFID technology and integrating with the Licensing Management System (LMS) provided by ImageTrendâ„¢.

## Overview

The current permitting process in West Virginia involves paper-based permits and manual inspections, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces a digital solution by utilizing RFID tags to store permit information and enabling field inspectors to update and validate permits during annual vehicle inspections using RFID readers.

Additionally, the project encourages ambulance agencies to adopt modern fleet management and supply chain practices by providing a portion of the RFID tag for their internal use.

## Features

- **Digitized Permitting Process**: Transition from traditional paper-based permits to secure and tamper-proof RFID tags.
- **LMS Integration**: Retrieve vehicle and permit data from ImageTrend's LMS to populate RFID tags.
- **Streamlined Inspections**: Field inspectors can efficiently read and update permit information using RFID readers during annual vehicle inspections.
- **Agency Modernization**: A portion of the RFID tag is available for ambulance agencies to utilize for fleet maintenance, supply tracking, and resupply management.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement encryption and tamper-proofing measures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of permit data stored on RFID tags.
